# DistTF
A sample usage for Distributed TensorFlow CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

This is a simple example of how to use TensorFlow in a distributed setting. The code is well-documented, to provide 
assistance to all who would like to use distributed TensorFlow. 

This example illustrates asynchronous parameter updates, and between-graph replication.
